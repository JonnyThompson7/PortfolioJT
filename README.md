This is my submission for the Module 2 Challenge of creating our own Portfolio.

This is my Portfolio, when you open the tab you will see the page title of "Portfolio" with 3 headers. Each header (About me, Work, and Contact Me) when clicked will take you to the section of the page containing information within that section. A little farther down on the page you will see my name, Jonathan Thompson, and my avatar who is bowing spanning the entire header. 

Here is the link to deployed action https://jonnythompson7.github.io/PortfolioJT/

Here is a screenshot of the page

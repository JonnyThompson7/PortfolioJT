This is my submission for the Module 2 Challenge of creating our own Portfolio.

This is my Portfolio, when you open the tab you will see the page title of "Portfolio" with 3 headers. Each header (About me, Work, and Contact Me) when clicked will take you to the section of the page containing information within that section. A little farther down on the page you will see my name, Jonathan Thompson, and my avatar who is bowing spanning the entire header. 

Here is the link to deployed action
